Put the pre_trained weight of estimation model and prediction model under the folder named as `Estimation.tar` and `Gating_prediction.tar` or change the path of weights in `movie_processing.py`

The format of movie video and json file of LCR key joints shall be similar to the example in `Movie_data` (the LCRKeypoint.zip should be unzip)

Run `python main.py` to find the most similar movie clips to the example video in `Synthetic_latent`
